Using the REST API at https://fakerestapi.azurewebsites.net/index.html (/api/v1/Books) write a front-end application to do the following:

- User should see a list of books from the API, showing: 'title', 'description' and 'publish date'
- User should be able to filter by 'title' and/or 'publish date'

Some extra tasks if time allows it:

- Implement paging or infinite scrolling
- Make the app responsive
 
You can use either Javascript or Typescript as the language.
We prefer VueJS or Angular as the framework, but any other is also valid.

Upload your work to GitHub with a Readme on how to install and run the application or send it to us in a ZIP.
